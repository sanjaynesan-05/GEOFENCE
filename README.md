# 🛰️ GeoFence NDVI Analyzer 🌿

A web-based **GeoSpatial Intelligence Platform** to draw or walk geofences and analyze **NDVI vegetation** and **building coverage** using **Sentinel-2 satellite data** from **Google Earth Engine**.

Built using modern **HTML/CSS/JS**, **Leaflet.js**, **Turf.js**, and a **Flask + Earth Engine backend**, this tool is tailor-made for smart land-use, agriculture, and urban analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📁 Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjaynesan-05/GEOFENCE.git
cd GEOFENCE
````

---

### ⚙️ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Make sure you're authenticated with [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install) and update the `project=` ID if needed.

---

### 🌐 Frontend Setup

Just open `index.html` in the `frontend/` directory, or serve with Live Server in VS Code.

Make sure `login.html`, `register.html`, and `style.css` are also included.

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

* New users can register (credentials stored with **bcrypt-hashed passwords** in SQLite).
* Successful login sets a `localStorage` flag (`loggedIn = true`).
* Users are auto-redirected to the main map.
* Logout clears the session.

---

## ✨ Features

* 📍 **Draw or walk polygons** on the map (supports mobile)
* 📊 **Live green/building/total area metrics** in m² and %
* 🛰️ **Sentinel-2 NDVI analysis** via Earth Engine
* 🌐 **Map Styles:** Satellite, OSM, Night Mode
* 🧊 Beautiful **Glassmorphism UI** (Material 3 inspired)
* 🔐 Simple login/register authentication
